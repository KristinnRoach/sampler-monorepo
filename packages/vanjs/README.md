**VanJS** is an **_ultra-lightweight_**, **_zero-dependency_** and **_unopinionated_** Reactive UI framework based on pure vanilla JavaScript and DOM. Programming with **VanJS** feels like building React apps in a [scripting language](https://vanjs.org/about#story), without JSX. Check-out the `Hello World` code below:

```javascript
// Reusable components can be just pure vanilla JavaScript functions.
// Here we capitalize the first letter to follow React conventions.
const Hello = () =>
  div(
    p('üëãHello'),
    ul(li('üó∫Ô∏èWorld'), li(a({ href: 'https://vanjs.org/' }, 'üç¶VanJS')))
  );

van.add(document.body, Hello());
// Alternatively, you can write:
// document.body.appendChild(Hello())
```

[Try on jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/vanjs-org/vanjs-org.github.io/tree/master/jsfiddle/home/hello)

You can convert any HTML or MD snippet into **VanJS** code with our online [converter](https://vanjs.org/convert).

**VanJS** helps you manage states and UI bindings as well, with a more natural API:

```javascript
const Counter = () => {
  const counter = van.state(0);
  return div(
    '‚ù§Ô∏è ',
    counter,
    ' ',
    button({ onclick: () => ++counter.val }, 'üëç'),
    button({ onclick: () => --counter.val }, 'üëé')
  );
};

van.add(document.body, Counter());
```

## Why VanJS?

### Reactive Programming without React/JSX

Declarative DOM tree composition, reusable components, reactive state binding - **VanJS** offers every good aspect that React does, but without the need of React, JSX, transpiling, virtual DOM, or any hidden logic. Everything is built with simple JavaScript functions and DOM.

### Grab 'n Go

**_No installation_**, **_no configuration_**, **_no dependencies_**, **_no transpiling_**, **_no IDE setups_**. Adding a line to your script or HTML file is all you need to start coding. And any code with **VanJS** can be pasted and executed directly in your browser's developer console. **VanJS** allows you to focus on the business logic of your application, rather than getting bogged down in frameworks and tools.

### Ultra-Lightweight

**VanJS** is the smallest reactive UI framework in the world, with just 1.0kB in the gzipped minified bundle. It's **50~100 times** smaller than most popular alternatives. Guess what you can get from this 1.0kB framework? All essential features of modern web frameworks - DOM templating, state, state binding, state derivation, effect, SPA, client-side routing and even hydration!

### Easy to Learn

Simplicity at its core. Only 5 functions (`van.tags`, `van.add`, `van.state`, `van.derive`, `van.hydrate`). The entire tutorial plus the API reference is [just one single web page](https://vanjs.org/tutorial), and can be learned within 1 hour for most developers.

### Performance

**VanJS** is among the fastest web frameworks, according to the [results](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2023/table_chrome_117.0.5938.62.html) by [krausest/js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark). For SSR, **Mini-Van** is [**1.75X** to **2.25X** more efficient](https://github.com/vanjs-org/mini-van/tree/main/bench#react-vs-mini-van) compared to React.

### TypeScript Support

**VanJS** provides first-class support for TypeScript. With the `.d.ts` file in place, you'll be able to take advantage of type-checking, IntelliSense, large-scale refactoring provided by your preferred development environment. Refer to the [Download Table](https://vanjs.org/start#download-table) to find the right `.d.ts` file to work with.
