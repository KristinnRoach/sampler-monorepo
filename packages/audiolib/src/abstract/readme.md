This is still WIP. The idea was to provide a clear structure for the audiolib as a graph, common base interface for nodes, nodeId and type system and event listening / dispatching for the purpose of **simplifying** further development. I kindof gave up before finding a good 'base' solution, in favor of getting started prototyping quickly. Might be unnecessary, might revisit. The goal is to keep things as clear and simple as possible.
