## Overview

HljÃ³Ã°-Smali is a monorepo project containing custom audio processing packages and UI components for building browser-based musical instruments. The project demonstrates modern web development practices including TypeScript, modular architecture, and real-time audio processing.

## Features

- **Real-time audio sampling**: Record audio directly from your microphone
- **Keyboard-based playback**: Play samples using computer keyboard like a piano
- **Audio manipulation**: Transpose, detune, and apply envelope controls
- **Loop controls**: Loop samples with customizable points
- **Visual feedback**: Waveform display with interactive controls

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Web Audio API** - Real-time audio processing
- **TurboRepo** - Monorepo management
- **Vite** - Fast build tooling
- **Vanilla Web Components** - Framework-agnostic UI components

## Project Structure

This monorepo contains:

- **`packages/audiolib`** - Core audio processing engine extending Web Audio API
- **`packages/audio-components`** - Reusable web components for audio UIs
- **`packages/input-controller`** - Keyboard input handling
- **`apps/play`** - Main sampler application

## Getting Started

```bash
